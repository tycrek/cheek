# What??

**cheek** is similar to my other project, [ass](https://github.com/tycrek/ass). The biggest difference is that cheek is runs on Cloudflare's **serverless platform**, where ass uses traditional hosting with Node.js.

# Roadmap

- [x] Upload (supports ShareX currently)
- [x] Fetch/view image
- [x] Embed features for Discord
- [ ] Delete image
- [ ] Multi-user

# Usage

You will be deploying to Cloudflare [Pages]. Before you begin, make sure you have setup:

| Bind type | Bind name |
| :-------: | --------- |
| [KV] | `cheekkv` |
| [R2] | `cheekstore` |

[Pages]: https://pages.cloudflare.com/
[KV]: https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/developer-platform/workers-kv/
[R2]: https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/developer-platform/r2/

Run these commands to deploy:
